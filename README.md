pysay
=====
_v2.0.0, 14 Oct 2014_

Well, there's not so much to say about pysay, it's basically... cowsay! :D
This version, though, has been completely rewritten into Python, trying to
maintain the original behaviour of cowsay. Some gotchas has been corrected,
such as the way cowsay handles the *face* flags (you can use -d -b together
and you can do the same with -g -T, which is not so bad, but not so smart too).
Other minor little strange glitches have been fixed naturally during the
translation process. The way the input text is processed has been slightly
modified, improving the robustness against bad formatted text (please, have a
look at the source code for further information).

The script is now a little more multi-platform, just follow the instructions
in the INSTALL.md file that apply to your system.

If you're interested in the cowsay story, the README file of the standard
cowsay 3.03 by Tony Monroe should satisfy your curiosity (you can find it at:
[http://www.nog.net/~tony/warez](https://web.archive.org/web/20131220090456/http://www.nog.net/~tony/warez)).

This package contains the new cow file python.cow.
